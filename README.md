# Personal Website of Kharon Harrell (Old)
This is my first attempt at building a website from scratch with HTML, CSS, & Javascript.

### Installing

Step by step instructions to run my website
```
git clone https://github.com/khvrn/web.git
```
```
cd web/
```
This command will vary slightly depending on the browser you prefer. I am going to use Firefox for the example command:
```
firefox index.html
```
