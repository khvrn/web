                    <p>I am a junior pursing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at WVU. I have been able to balance coursework and various programming projects throughout my career as an undergraduate student, that have enabled me to further my understanding and skills that pertain to this role. Due to my experience, I have become exceptionally proficient with Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems, as well as troubleshooting software and hardware. As an individual who is interested in continuous professional development, I have dedicated more than 4 years of experience to using various software and systems to solve problems and complete tasks. As a result, I believe I am a competent individual in most computer science fields and still learning.</p>

                        <h4>Front End Development</h4>
                        <p>I want to breathe life into static code, especially code that will be directly interacted with by the user. Designing and creating a seamless user experience is what I strive for.</p>

                        <h4>Open Source Software</h4>
                        <p>Not only does it enable all programmers to develop and improve their skills, but it also  provides full authority over the software I'm using, controlling what it does and most importantly, doesn't.</p>

                        <h4>Art &amp; Design</h4>
                        <p>Design is integral to just about every aspect of life. I love using my creativity to enable understanding and better present information. Visual communication is king.</p>
